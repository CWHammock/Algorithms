CS520_HW4:

Application of the Horner Alogrithm: Traditionally, to compute the value for x in the polynomial f(x) = 5x4+7x3+3x2+2x+3, you would get the value for x and multiply the coefficient by the variable raised to the power of the exponent.  The number of multiplications needed for our original method is 5*x*x*x*x + 7*x*x*x + 3*x*x + 2*x + 3, which is 10 multiplications and 4 additions.  Hornerâ€™s method ingeniously keeps factoring out x to cut down on the number of multiplications.  This would leave the pervious problem looking like: x(x(x(5x+7)+3)+2)+3.  This makes the number of multiplications 4, down from 10.  The additions will not change.
